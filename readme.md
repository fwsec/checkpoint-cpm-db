# üë®‚Äçüíª Check Point CPM Deep Dive

A technical reference for exploring the internals of Check Point Management's CPM architecture. This repo documents the commands used by the **CPM Doctor Tool**, the structure of the **PostgreSQL databases** (`cpm` and `monitoring`), and provides a collection of useful `psql_client` queries for diagnostics, automation, and reverse engineering.

## üéì What Is CPM?

CPM (Check Point Management) is the backend engine powering SmartConsole and other management interfaces. It relies on a PostgreSQL database to store policy objects, logs, sessions, and monitoring data.

This repo aims to demystify CPM internals for engineers who want to:

- Understand how CPM Doctor diagnoses issues
- Explore the structure of the `cpm` and `monitoring` databases
- Run advanced queries using `psql_client`
- Build tools or scripts for Check Point automation

## üß™ Requirements

To run queries or scripts from this repo, you'll need:

- Access to a Check Point Management Server (R8x)
- System mode access (`expert`)
- `psql_client` installed and working
- Basic familiarity with PostgreSQL
